# Plasma Mobile Browser

This is an experimental webbrowser designed to 

- be used on small mobile devices,
- integrate well in Plasma workspaces

It is built on top of QtWebEngine, and thus requires Qt 5.4.

## Preliminary roadmap:
- [x] browser navigation: back + forward + reload
- [x] browser status
- [x] Implement URL bar
- [x] Error handler in UI
- [x] history store, model and UI
- [x] bookmarks store, model and UI
  - [x] add / remove
- [ ] in-window navigation: tabs vs. top bar
- [ ] SSL error handler
- [x] Touch actions (pinch?) (done in QtWebEngine)
- [x] user-agent to request mobile site
- [x] open and close new tabs
- [x] History based completion
- [x] Right click / long press menu
- [x] purpose integration (for kdeconnect)
- [ ] adblock
- [ ] kwallet integration
